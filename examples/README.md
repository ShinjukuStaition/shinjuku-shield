# Examples

Configs and walkthroughs for the Shinjuku Shielded MCP server: the private
x402 facilitator on Solana, inside your agent.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [claude-code.md](claude-code.md) | The setup command, the `claude mcp add` command, Tor, the caps, and how to check it works. |
| [claude-desktop.json](claude-desktop.json) | A complete `claude_desktop_config.json`. |
| [cursor.json](cursor.json) | A complete `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or `.cursor/mcp.json` in a project). |
| [hermes.md](hermes.md) | The Hermes Agent `config.yaml` entry (stdio). |
| [vercel-ai-sdk.md](vercel-ai-sdk.md) | The Vercel AI SDK: connect the server's tools to `generateText` through `@ai-sdk/mcp`. |
| [Solana Agent Kit plugin](https://github.com/ShinjukuStaition/shinjuku-sak-plugin) | npm `solana-agent-kit-plugin-shinjuku`: the wallet as Solana Agent Kit v2 actions (`SHINJUKU_X402_PAY` and others). |
| [prompts.md](prompts.md) | 13 plain requests, the tool that each one calls, and the shape of the answer. |

All examples run `npx -y --no-audit --no-fund shinjuku-shield@0.3.86 mcp`: the stable version
(pinned 2026-10-23, wallet release `b650bf06`). The commands and flags come
from `help mcp` and `help setup` of that release.

## Where it runs

- Linux: ready.
- Windows: the wallet runs the provers through WSL. Setup checks that
  `wsl.exe` runs; if it does not, run `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`. If the host
  cannot find `npx`, use `"command": "cmd"` and put `"/c", "npx"` at the
  start of `args`.
- macOS: not supported. Setup says so and creates nothing.

## First 10 minutes

Each step shows what you do, or what you say to the agent and the tool that
the agent calls. Tool arguments are in atomic USDC: 1000000 = 1 USDC. Flags you type (setup, mcp) are in USDC: 0.05 = 5 cents.

### 1. Install Node.js 22.21 or later (or Node.js 24 or later)

```sh
node --version
```

The output must be `v22` or higher.

### 2. Set it up in a terminal

```sh
npm install -g shinjuku@0.3.86
shinjuku setup
```

In our runs, setup took about 10-16 s on a fast line, with the proof-tool
download of about 191 MB. Add `--add-to claude-code` (or `claude-desktop`,
`cursor`) to also add the server to that host's config.

Setup writes to `~/.carbon-shielded-wallet`:

- The wallet, a random passphrase file (readable by you alone, never
  printed), the proof tools (every file checked), and `config.json`.
- A recovery file with the seed and the Solana secret key. Copy it to two
  offline places, then delete it from this machine.
- No spending limit by default: only the balance bounds a payment. To set
  limits, run the setup with `--max-payment`, `--max-session`, and
  `--max-cumulative`, in USDC (`shinjuku help setup`).

### 3. Add the server to your agent

Use one of [claude-code.md](claude-code.md), [claude-desktop.json](claude-desktop.json),
[cursor.json](cursor.json), or [hermes.md](hermes.md). Restart the agent
host after you change its config. If you gave `--add-to` in step 2, the
config is done.

You can also add the server first and skip step 2:

| You say | The agent calls |
|---|---|
| "what is my balance" | `shinjuku_setup`. Your client asks you to confirm that it may create a Shinjuku Shielded wallet on this machine, with the caps. |

Accept. The setup runs (with the proof-tool download of about 191 MB) and
the same server switches to the wallet tools. If your client cannot show the
question, run `shinjuku setup` in a terminal, then restart
the agent host.

### 4. Add funds

| You say | The agent calls |
|---|---|
| "add 0.50 USDC to my shielded balance" | `wallet_add_funds`. The answer has a new one-time Solana address of this wallet and a `solana:` pay link. |

Send the USDC (Solana SPL) to that address from any wallet or exchange.
Amounts from 0.01 USDC work. You do not need SOL: our relayer pays every
fee. A few minutes after the USDC arrives, it becomes private by itself
while the MCP server runs. One round takes up to 5 USDC; a larger amount
goes in by rounds. Use each address for one payer. The call itself moves no
money.

USDC that is already on the wallet's own address goes in with
`wallet_shield`:

| You say | The agent calls |
|---|---|
| "what is my wallet address?" | `wallet_balance`. The answer has `ownAddress`: the wallet's own public Solana address. |
| "shield 2 USDC" | `wallet_shield {amount_atomic: "2000000", request_id: "shield-1"}` |

The shield takes a few minutes. The first call starts it and answers a
`stage`. The agent calls `wallet_shield` again with the same `request_id` to
read the stage. The same `request_id` never starts a second deposit. When
the deposit lands, the wallet reads it from the chain and writes an
encrypted backup to `$SHIELDED_WALLET_HOME/auto-backups/<pool>/` by itself.
`wallet_shield` takes any amount from 0.01 USDC, while the shielded balance stays at most 5 USDC.

A shield is a public step. The chain shows USDC leave the wallet's own
address, the amount, and the time. Payments from the shielded balance after
that do not show this wallet. For the exchange route in a terminal, see
`shinjuku help add-funds`.

### 5. Pay a URL

| You say | The agent calls |
|---|---|
| "find a seller of weather data" | `x402_discover`. It searches public x402 listings on your machine and pays nothing. The first call takes about 15 s. |
| "what does https://seller.example/report cost?" | `x402_preview {url}`. It pays nothing. It shows the seller's price and whether your caps allow it. |
| "pay it" | `x402_pay {url}`. It pays the seller's price from your shielded balance and returns the answer. |

A paid answer has `paid: true` and a `transaction`. The agent must not say
that a payment happened without a `transaction`. A URL that does not answer
HTTP 402 is fetched once, and nothing is paid. A price above your caps is
refused before anything is signed. A standard `exact` seller (Coinbase CDP,
PayAI, or any other facilitator) is paid through Shinjuku: the wallet pays
us privately, the price plus a flat fee (`x402_preview` shows `feeAtomic`
and `totalAtomic`), and we pay the seller from our own float. If that seller
does not take the payment, the refund comes back to your balance by itself
within about 7 minutes. An image answer comes back as an image, and the file
is saved.

### 6. Send USDC to an address, with your confirmation

| You say | The agent calls |
|---|---|
| "send 0.5 USDC to <address>" | `wallet_unshield {amount_atomic: "500000", to: "<address>", request_id: "send-1"}` |

If `<address>` is not in `--unshield-to`, your client shows a question:
"Send 0.5 USDC from your shielded balance to <address>?". Only an accept
sends. A decline, or no answer in 5 minutes, sends nothing. The model
cannot answer this question; your client app asks you.

- The receiving address must already have its USDC token address (a wallet
  that holds USDC has one).
- The wallet's own address is refused: it made the deposits, so a send there
  would link them.
- Our facilitator pays every network fee. The send takes minutes (one
  5-minute pool epoch is normal).
- An unshield is a public step. The chain shows the amount, the receiving
  address, and the time. The pool hides which deposit paid it.

### 7. Check the balance

| You say | The agent calls |
|---|---|
| "what is my balance" | `wallet_balance` |

The answer shows one balance (`balanceAtomic`, what the agent can pay with)
and UNSHIELDED (`unshieldedAtomic`, plain USDC on the wallet's own address),
with `ownAddress` and `status` (`"current"` when the balance is read).
`breakdown` names what the one balance holds: `shieldedAtomic` (what the
agent can send with `wallet_unshield`), `refundsInFlightAtomic`, and
`setAsideAtomic` (pockets of an older version).

## What others can see

- The seller sees your request, the price, and the time. It sees your IP
  unless you use `--tor`.
- Your agent host and its model provider see every URL, price, paid answer,
  amount, and send address that the agent handles. A local model removes
  that observer.
- Our facilitator processes your payments. It keeps no access logs.
- On chain, a shielded payment does not show who paid. Privacy needs a
  crowd: with few users, timing can still link payments.
